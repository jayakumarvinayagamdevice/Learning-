 * Dependency Injection:
Which allows us to develop loosely coupled software components.In other way we may say like
to reduce the tight coupling between software components.
 -> reduce complexity
 -> easy to adopt future change

Tight Coupling: Class is dependent on another class. similar objec are dependent on another object.
If we change dependent object, then we also need to change the classes where this dependent object is used.
Uf it small one then it is not that difficult to handle but if we have a big enterprise level application, then its really very difficult to
handle make the changes.
